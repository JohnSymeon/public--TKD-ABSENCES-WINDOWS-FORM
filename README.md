# public--TKD-ABSENCES-WINDOWS-FORM
This Windows Forms App developed in C# is used to track the consequent absences of students.
Every student key has a name, consequent absences, id, date from last update, exact time from last update and the class they belong to.

<h3> Create an excel file with the correct format or open an already existing generated one</h3>

Every sheet inside the excel file represents a different class

<h3> Add a class at the end of all classes or switch between them</h3>

1)If Absent, another consequent absence is added to their absences number

2)If Presnet, consequent absences reset to 0

3)If neither of both are selected, the student's absences value simply is not updated

<h3>To delete one or multiple students hit the "Delete a student window" button</h3>
A popup window is instantiated in which the user can select multiple students before clicking delete

<h3> To add a new student to the current class, type inside the field the person's name and then click save student </h3>
